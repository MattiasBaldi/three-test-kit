# three-test-kit

An asset helper tool inspired by blenderkit, created to improve workflow when finding assets like models, textures, hdris. Instead of having to manually upload and test individual assets to your scene, you can surf directly through polyhavens assets using their public API. 

Made with react three fiber.
